***Overview of the Analysis***

The purpose of the analysis

W.Avy seeks to retrun to Oahu, Hawaii to open a sufs and ice cream shop and would like to get investors for his business. The greatest concern is the weather. After a range of analysis, W. Avy desires additional information on temperature trends for the months of June and December. Using Squalchemy, SQLite and Flask, we seek to assist W.Avy with these information and present same in a manner of interest to the investors.

***Results***


*Three key differences in weather*

* Tempertures on the month of June  of June range from 64 to 85 while those for December were lower ranging from 56 - 83.

* The highest and lowest temperatures for the June ranged within the middle of the month while those for December are at the towards the beginning and end of the month.

* A summary of the statistics reveal an average drop of 3 points per central tendency measurements.

***Summary***

While temperatures for both months cannot be considered extreme, the month of December is cooler than the month of June, with the highest temperature in the seventies and eighties respectively. Mean temperatues  for June was 74.9 with a standard deviation of 3,25, while that for june was 71.04 with a standard deviation of 3,74. 50 percentile of the temperatures for June fell on 75degrees while that for December was 71 degrees.
In conclusion, both months would yield good results. With higher temperatures in June, there is a likelihood of increased demand for surfing and sales ice cream.

Two additional queries:

* We could have a query that allows us get stations for ther temperature observations.

* We could also determine a specific temperature we desire and have a query using groupby function to determine stations with that temperature.
